These CSV files contain annual extreme heat counts for California counties and
census tracts. The analysis was run for the four priority models, HadGEM2-ES,
CNRM-CM5, CanESM2, and MIROC5, with both RCP 4.5 and 8.5.

The file with "98p" in the name provides the 98th percentile used to determine
the extreme heat threshold for that location. See
http://cal-adapt.org/tools/extreme-heat/ for a detailed description and
methodology.
